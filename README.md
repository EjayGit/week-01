## Assignment reflection
- I feel relatively satisfied with my submission. I would have liked to have spent more time on it doing the stretch requirements but I enjoyed my weekend hobbying too. :)
- I did not use any external sources other than to gain the photos of the sheep images.
- On rare occassion I placed an input into the css and the action was not as expected, ie. no change when I expected one. I removed the code and tried another course of action.
- I was happy to have completed 98% of the project before 5pm on Friday. This was important to me.

## Course reflection
- Week 01 has been a mix. In the main it has been a deep refresher on known principles and code with unknowns thrown in, such as the DOM, and javascript. These parts were a challenge.
