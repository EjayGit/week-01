## Course reflection
- Week 01 has been a mix. In the main it has been a deep refresher on known principles and code with unknowns thrown in, such as the DOM, and javascript. These parts were a challenge.

## Website Reqs
- Ensure each section is wrapped using sematic tags. COMPLETED
- Use absolute positioning to overlay text onto an element.
- Use CSS flexbox for the nav element at least.
- Ensire all images have accurate filepaths.
